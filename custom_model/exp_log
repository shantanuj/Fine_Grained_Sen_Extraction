EXPERIMENTS:

1) seq2seq only



2) seq2seq+ bilstm crf
    a) Rest
	a) Seq2seq (50d) trained for TR Rest only. Epochs ~ 200 with lr of 0.25 then 0.025 with 0.99 cut: Tr loss  at 0.9927 Te loss 3.4 ~ 1/2 hr
          ABSA accuracy: 
	  
        b) Continued training of testing set and retrain absa model for couple epochs. Overall seq2seq loss: ____ ; 
  
          ABSA accuracy: 
	
	





	Now for 100d 

    b) Laptop


    c) Transfer: How to: Given a model trained for Ds, retrain seq2seq for that model with Dt, and tree kernel is passed as input.


3) seq2seq + tree embeds only


4) seq2seq + tree embeds + geo embeds


5)  Bilstm crf only

    a) Laptop



    b) Rest
