EXPERIMENTS:

1) seq2seq only



2) seq2seq+ bilstm crf
    a) Rest
	Seq2seq trained for TR Rest only. Epochs ~ 100 with lr of 0.25 with 0.99 cut: Tr loss  Te loss _ ~ 1/2 hr
	
	Seq2seq includes TE training for couple epochs. Before classification (frozen)


    b) Laptop


    c) Transfer: How to: Given a model trained for Ds, retrain seq2seq for that model with Dt, and tree kernel is passed as input.


3) seq2seq + tree embeds only


4) seq2seq + tree embeds + geo embeds


5)  Bilstm crf only

    a) Laptop



    b) Rest
